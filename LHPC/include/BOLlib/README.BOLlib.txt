 Now that the legalese preamble is out of the way, the description of the code
 and how to use it can begin!

 BOLlib is a set of classes written in C++ for the private use of Ben O'Leary,
 but made publically available in case it would be useful for others, in
 particular also to be distributed as part of LesHouchesParserClasses.

 Unfortunately I am too lazy to write full documentation for these classes. I
 hope that the comments and the function names are sufficiently descriptive
 to allow others to use the classes.

CHANGELOG:
 * 10th September 2012: version 0.1.0
 - first release!

The C++ files of LesHouchesParserClasses are:
 include/AsciiXmlParser.hpp
 include/BasicObserved.hpp
 include/BasicObserver.hpp
 include/CommentedTextParser.hpp
 include/PushingObserved.hpp
 include/PushedToObserver.hpp
 include/StdVectorFiller.hpp
 include/StringParser.hpp
 include/UsefulStuff.hpp
 include/VectorlikeArray.hpp
 source/BasicObserved.cpp
 source/AsciiXmlParser.cpp
 source/BasicObserver.cpp
 source/CommentedTextParser.cpp
 source/StringParser.cpp
 source/UsefulStuff.cpp
 Makefile
 and README.BOLlib.txt (copied as README.txt) which describes the package.
